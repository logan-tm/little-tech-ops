# Littleton Technician Operations

(aka "Little Tech Ops" or "LTO")

A project to showcase a fullstack application using:

- Tanstack Router & Query
- Vite & React
- tRPC
- PostgreSQL
- fly.io

LTO is a simulation of a technician warehouse, dispatching techs to complete "jobs" with materials and equipment.

This README is a WIP, it will be updated as time goes on.
